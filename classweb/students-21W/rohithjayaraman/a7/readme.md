# Assignment 7 - Array of Floats
My work for this assignment was inspired by something that shaped my childhood and continues to inspire, excite me now - Pokemon. The catification algorithm that I wrote is a naive approach to generate different evolutions of eevee - the evolution pokemon. Eevee already has many forms and will have many more. This is a simple idea to try and capture that. 

Try to generate some cool faces!

## Sliders
There are sliders to control - 
- The angle of the eyes and the position of the pupil within the eyes
- The angle of the ears
- The main colour (Hue, Saturation and Luminosity/Brightness) of the face and ears
- The colour of the inner ears (Hue, Luminosity/Brightness)
- The colour of the eyes (Hue, Luminosity/Brightness)
- The colour of the pupils (Hue, Luminosity/Brightness)

## Landmarks
There are 6 landmarks, each representing eevee/one of its evolutions - eevee itself, flareon, jolteon, vaporeon, umbreon and espeon.
