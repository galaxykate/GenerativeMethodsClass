# Assignment 6 - Cellular automaton

## Peer pressure

The aim of my cellular automaton was to represent peer pressure in teenagers. The basic setup involves 3 types of teenagers - regular joe(ðŸ˜„), cowboy joe(ðŸ¤ ) and cool guy joe (ðŸ˜Ž). Each person tries to influence others to be like them but only when there is a group/collective effort to influence a person does it actually work. I tried to model the resilience level of individuals, the group size by which an individual is influenced as well as the individual impact each person has on an individual. 

## Controls
There are buttons to randomise (labelled new) the grid, move the grid by one step, play/pause. There are sliders on two of the grids with a label for what the slider represents. There are also radio buttons to choose which emoji to draw onto the grid as well as a text field showing which mode is currently selected. Click on any cell in the grid to modify/draw on it. 

## Thoughts
I feel that this is a good attempt at modelling peer pressure. It puts across the point that I wanted to make. Does it bring across the argument that I wanted to make? Kind of. I wanted to show that peer pressure is important and show how it is influenced by different factors. It definitly does the latter but the former is not brought out as much as I expected since there is no direct value of having more cowboy emojis or cool guy emojis on screen. I feel that this is a probable simulation and not a possible one since there are so many other factors that need to be considered when modelling peer pressure.
