# Assignment 3 - Drawing tool

The aim of the assignment was to create a casual creator - a drawing tool using P5 that had atleast 3 unique modes (one of which used splines/bezier curves).

I created a drawing tool called 'dROw your heart out' (a shameless pun, I know). It has 3 modes. There is a text on screen mentioning the currently selected mode and a clear canvas button that clears the canvas.

## Mode 1 - Snitch
The snitch mode draws a snitch where the mouse is clicked. The snitch is animated i.e. its wings move. The wings are erased and redrawn once in a few frames so if anything else is drawn or placed on top of the snitch, it kind of goes away. 

## Mode 2 - Party flag
This mode draws a triangle party flag as the mouse is dragged across the canvas

## Mode 3 - Marker
The marker mode gives more control to the user by letting them draw anything of their choice, just that it seems like you are drawing using a permanent marker. Additionally, the marker mode offers a color picker (red/blue/green/orange/purple/pink/black) using which you can change the colour of the marker. Another fun feature is that the color picker uses the text color as the color currently selected.
