# Assignment 9 - Costumes
The aim of the assignment was to make a costume of sorts for yourself. The face and hand detection data was provided by handsfree.js and a lot of work by Professor Kate. So using the face and hand data, you had make something a little cool.

I went ahead and made what I call a fire face. Basically your face is rendered as a fiery face with layers of flames. The flames dance around to give an effect of movement. The hands are rendered as spots of fire. Each part of the hand is like a small independent fire and all of them together make the shape of the hand. 

## SLIDERS
1. FlameLength : Adjusts the length of the flames that dance around as part of the face
2. FlameSpeed : Adjusts the speed at which the flames dance around
3. PalmSize : Adjusts the size of the fire representing the palm of each hand
