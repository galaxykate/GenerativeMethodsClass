# Assignment 2 - Animations

The aim of the assignment was to create 3 GIFs/animations using P5. 

## Animation 1
The first animation is an optical illusion that is made by drawing an archimedes spiral. 

## Animation 2
The second animation is a bouncing ball. The initial position is randomly decided and after that the ball follows basic laws of physics i.e. it bounces of surfaces (borders of the canvas)

## Animation 3
The third animation is 2 people battling using lightsabers but the lightsabers are not constant in length. Also, there are stars shining in the background.
